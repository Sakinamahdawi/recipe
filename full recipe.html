        Instructions:</b></p><br>
        <p>
        1. Prepare the Dough:
        Mix flour and salt, then gradually add water while kneading until you get a soft, smooth dough. Knead for about 10 minutes, cover with a towel, and let it rest for 30 minutes.
        <br>
        <br>
         2. Prepare the Filling:
        Mix chopped green onions and cilantro with salt and pepper. You can add a little olive oil if desired.
        <br><br>
         3. Make the Meat Sauce:
        In a pan, sauté the onion in oil until golden. Add garlic and ground meat, cook until browned. Stir in tomato paste, spices, and water. Simmer for about 20 minutes until the sauce thickens.
        <br><br>
         4. Make the Yogurt Sauce:
        Mix the yogurt with crushed garlic and a pinch of salt. Set aside.
        <br><br>
         5. Assemble the Ashak:
        Roll out the dough and cut it into small circles. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each, fold and seal the edges like a dumpling.
        <br><br>
         6. Cook the Ashak:
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop in the dumplings and cook for 5–7 minutes or until they float and are cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon.
        <br><br>
          7. Serving:
        Arrange the cooked dumplings on a plate. Top with yogurt sauce and then the meat sauce. Garnish with dried mint or chili flakes if desired.
